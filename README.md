This is a website to show metrics from the terminal competition over time.

The project was originally created by @876584635678890 and almost all of the work is his. I simply brought it over since he no longer seems to be maintaining the code.
You can access the original repository here: https://github.com/876584635678890/876584635678890.github.io.
